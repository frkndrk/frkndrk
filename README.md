I am a Front End Developer who is open to development and loves to learn.

I tend to learn constantly because I think that continuous learning keeps people young and vigorous. There is always something new to learn.

I have a structure that focuses on his work, is highly motivated, and gives importance to the details of the work. I think my meticulousness is my biggest advantage when it comes to coding.

I know how to code HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SCSS, JavaScript and use GitHub. I'm learning React. Afterwards, I aim to become a talented Mobile Application Developer by learning React Native.

I'm a fan of clean, functional, workable and readable coding.

I can work both independently and with a team. I believe that great achievements will be achieved by teams with a strong team spirit.
